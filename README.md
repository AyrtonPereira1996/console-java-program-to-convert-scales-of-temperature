# Program to convert Scales Of Temperature

This repository is about a program that does conversion of three types of temperature scales as:

**1. Celsius:**
  - Celsius to Kelvin;
  - Celsius to Fahrenheit;
  
**2. Kelvin:**
  - Kelvin to Celsius;
  - Kelvin to Fahrenheit;
  
**3. Fahrenheit:**
  - Fahrenheit to Celsius;
  - Fahrenheit to kelvin;

## How to run this program?

**You could run this program on your IDE or in your terminal:

**On IDE:**

I created this program on ECLIPSE. So, if you want to run this program on ECLIPSE IDE, you must do the next steps:
- You must first download the code at [Ayrton repository GitHub]https://github.com/AyrtonPereira1996/console-java-program-to-convert-scales-of-temperature

- Second, you need to import the archive that contains the code that you download to ECLIPSE. So you import as an "Existing Projects into Workspace"

- Once the project is in the eclipse workspace you must find the class that contains the main method and RUN...

**On Terminal (OS Linux - Linux mint, ubuntu, debian)**

- First, to run any java program in the terminal you must have JDK installed on your machine
- Once you have the JDK installed on your powerful machine, you must compile at the same time all the files with extension .java in the **main/** and **escalas/** project packages.

  1. First goes inside to the location where the project was save and than enter inside the project folder.
  
  **cd folder_where_you_put_the_project/console-java-program-to-convert-scales-of-temperature-master**
  
  3. Second, once you are at project folder you must run the command that will compile all the .java files that have to be compiled with the command:
    
  **javac src/main/calculo/temperatura/.java src/escalas/calculo/temperatura/.java**

  3. After compiling the .java files, you can run the main class to start the program with the command:
  
  **java src/main/calculo/temperatura/CalculoEscalasMainClass**
